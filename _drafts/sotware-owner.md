The Charity Major's talk during Jazoon Conference in Bern was as usual dence of
concepts and experience but the one that created more friction was about the
concept of software ownership.

I kind of understand where it comes from and here is about what *I* think is a
sofrware owner today.

There is not a complete software owner, in practice is probably the company you
work from but other than that different people runs different responsabilities
on the same piece of crappy code.

As a Software Engineer I won't owner the roadmap for the project probably
because it is out of my scope, so I think the tweet from my good friend Lee
Calcote, Docker Captain and CNCF Ambassador doesn't fit in what I am thinking
right now.

But I am also not really into the Agile Manifesto crew, I like a lot what Agile
means, but for me it serves just a lot of great tools and methodologies, I used
some of them but I never worked in a company that "fully apply Agile" and I
don't know if it matters at all.

Anyway, the tweet is about ownership from the prospective of "who keeps the
application running".

Who writes code is often a great candidate to understand and fix outages quicker
than everyone else. That's why a lot of companies are trying to push Software
Engineers on call.

Personally I started my careers six years ago it means that luckily for me, even
during my first job when I was writing a tool in PHP to manage tools in a lab I
was the one delivering the code. All the DevOps
movement was already a thing, I don't suffer a mental and cultural shock
because it is like that since day one.

I am rephrasing something that Charity Major's added to enforce this concept. It
is time for software engineer to learn something new because ops guy learned how
to code (this is about infra as code and so on).

I think something a software engineer that I need to learn is troubleshooting
and debugging in production in an effective way, to be clear I make it every day
because it is part of my daily job but I think I put too much effort to get not
so much.
