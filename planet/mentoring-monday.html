title: "Mentoring Monday"
summary: "Mentoring Monday is popular hashtag on Twitter #MentoringMonday that
goes of on Monday, where you look or apply to be a mentor for a particular set
of items. It can be work related or even a passion. I like to do it because I
get to speak with a lot of enthusiast and interesting people. I decided to
collect and re-post selected questions and response because almost all of them
are made privatelly via DMs on Twitter."
