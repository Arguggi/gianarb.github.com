["Thinking in Systems"](https://amzn.to/3khu7k9) acted on me as a **reinforcing loop**. The motivation I have to
explore the ability to think of Software as loops and systems show up reading
those pages.

It is a great way to put words close to concepts I am exploring in practice. It
is not a book written for developers, but you know, it works, and you can apply
what you read everywhere.

Words are coming from [Donatella Meadows][1], the author of this book, a
scientist, author, teacher, and a system analyst.

If you enjoyed ["Reactive planning and reconciliation in Go."][2] this book is a
great way to go deeper into this topic without reading a long book; in the end,
it is less than 200 pages.

Systems are everywhere: the water cycle, the ability our body has to recover,
the evolution. This book helps you understand how to describe and spot them,
giving you the ability to see systems, such as when writing Software or when
looking for alternative solutions.

From my experience, when you can simplify a problem into a system, you get an
entity capable of balancing itself, a more resilient solution, and repeatable
workflow.

Self-balancing as a thermostat, for example. Resilient as a Kubernetes
reconciliation loop, repeatable as the water cycle is or an idempotent server
provisioning.
