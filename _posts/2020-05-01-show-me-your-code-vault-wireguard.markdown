## Let's write a Vault plugin for Wireguard

Tomorrow will be 1st of May. We are on vacation, a perfect that to start a side
project.

Giacomo and Philippe will start coding an integration between HashiCorp Vault
and Wireguard. This is great by itself. Vault is cool, Wireguard is awesome,
what do you need to know more?

The integration will be in form of a Vault plugin, we will meet online at 10am
(in Italy) and we will stream the session on
[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/gianarb). Are you an expert of the field? Do you want
to spend an hour coding with us? Are you looking for something to do? Just join
us and come to say hello!
