## Let's write a Vault plugin for Wireguard

1st of May. We are on vacation, the perfect day to start a side project.

Giacomo and Philippe started coding an integration between [HashiCorp
Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) and
[Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/). This is great by itself. Vault is cool,
Wireguard is awesome, what do you need more?

The integration is Vault plugin, and we decided to stream the session on
[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/gianarb) because that's what cool kids do those days.

We actually made it, as every side project it is not ready at all, but we got
the boilerplate code required by a Vault Plugin to work and the project is
available on GitHub
[gitirabassi/vault-plugin-secrets-wireguard)](https://github.com/gitirabassi/vault-plugin-secrets-wireguard).

After more than an hour of fun we had to stop but they promise we will have a
follow up meeting as soon as they have an E2E workflow to show me!
