summary: "I would like to layout a GitHub repository using Terraform that helps
me to manage GitHub organization via code in a collaborative way. I am not that
good with Terraform, even less when it comes to Terraform 0.12 and all the sweet
things it does. My friend David McKay aka @rawkode is way better than myself and
he will teach me a bunch of things live on Twitch"

Let's suppose I don't know a lot about Terraform because infrastructure as code
is not something that makes me happy. I know it is useful. There is a lot of
cool things in Terraform itself and I should know it more.

I happen to know and work with David that is always on top of the topic! I had
an idea, and he will help me to validate it live tomorrow August 29th in the
afternoon Central Europe.

We will put together a repository of "GitHub as Code" that we can use to
manage collaboratively a GitHub organisations:

1. Adding new members
2. Creating new teams
3. New repositories
4. Importing already created resources from GitHub to Terraform
5. If we can have a look at CI/CD with GitHub action and/or Terraform Cloud.

I will try first time [Visual Studio Code with Live
Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) and I think
David will teach me a lot of things about Terraform and 0.12 syntax.

This is something I hope we can use with
[Tinkerbell](https://github.com/tinkerbell).
