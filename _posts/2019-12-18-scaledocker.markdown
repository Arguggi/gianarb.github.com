In the process of make some order in all my repositories, side projects and so
on my terminal crossed over a project I made in 2017 called scaledocker. The
idea was a full book. It turned out to be a 2 pdf one describing Docker for a
totally beginner, the second one about security.

Looking back I see why I am so happy to build and share what I do, I am still
like that today!

I was discussing with Jenny about what do with this project and we thought about
the possibility to refresh those contents as part of a series in docker.com.

I had a look around at this scenario, the contents are still good but I can't
find the raw version of the PDF. It makes this work very hard. That's why I
decided to archive it here.

scaledocker.com will stay up and running redirecting everybody to this article,
where you can find both PDFs. It is for sale, just [make an
offer](mailto:ciao@gianarb.it) you can have it starting from Sept 2020.

This is not at end at all! There is an all section in my blog related to
[docker](/planet/docker.html) and who knows what I will work on in 2020! I just
do not like the idea to have this project keeping a domain busy, I bet there are
people that can make a better use of it as I tried to do few years ago!

In order to stay in touch with me my website is a good way and I rumble a lot on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/gianarb) as well!

{:class="small"}
55 pages


![](/img/container-security.png){:class="img-fluid w-25 p-3 float-right"}


When you think about production everything stops to be a joke. Containers, cloud
computing, scalability is something that fit well with security? I have my
personal response for this question and with this paper I am going to show what
I mean with security and how containers, docker, Linux can make this real.

1. Introduction
2. Mutual TLS and Security by default
3. Content Trust
4. Overlay Network
5. Docker Bench Security
6. Process Restriction and Capabilities
7. Open Source
8. Linux Kernel Security
9. Cilium
10. About your images
11. Secret Manager
12. Immutability

## Let's move on!

I hope this project will keep helping new folks to get onboard with Docker or to
figure out what they can do to improve security.

From what I can tell more than 2200 people required those PDFs! I am happy and
impressed. I can't wait to see what we will do next!
