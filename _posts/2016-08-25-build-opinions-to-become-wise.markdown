I am Gianluca, I am 24 years old and I work like Software Engineer.

I like my work because there are really a lot of different kinds of Software
Engineer, in first because you can work in pretty much every environment like
technology, food, cook, sport, fashion.

Also because there are a lot of stuff to do, if you like to work on a product,
you build features to make happy other people to buy a car or to read a news on
a online news paper.

If you like play with cables, racks, switchs you can work in a big or small
farm and design fancy datanceters.

But I like this work because a lot of people have opinions. There are opinions
builded on top of big study or after a long experience but everyone is happy to
share them and use them to build a new product.

I am a good PHP developer, because I worked for a while with this language and
I tried to catch and verify good opinions from a lot of developers that come
from different parts of the world and from different experiences.

I am happy so share someone of them with you:

```php
<?php 
namespace Opinion\One;

class Good {
    public function __contruct($somethingThatIReallyNeed)
    {
        $this->important = $somethingThatIReallyNeed;
    }
}
```

Usually I force myself (and when I can other people :P ) to inject objects from
contructor if our object (Good) can not work without them.

This is a good way to be sure that your object will be completed, because you can not forgot nothing!

I use Zend Framework from a lot of time and I remember one class
`ServiceLocatorAwareInterface`.

I have an opion, I hate this class.

If you implement this interface your service has a service locator! It's
powerfull today that you need to finish your ticket and go away with a new
feature.
After months a lot of people improve this service and they start to use a lot
of other services without think about for what reason you builded your service.
Just because it's really simple get random services from service locator.

Be wise, don't allow people to write bad code and use your constructor to inject your dependencies!!

I have also architecture opinions like:

When you think about "How can I resolve this problem?" you must start from
design pattern! They are documented and tested from a lot of developers and in
more use cases.

Imagine your colleague that come to you around 5pm to ask how an entire
libraries is designed, you can just reply "It's just a SOAL client, see you
tomorrow!" and you go to play basketball.

Or if you are building an API, OAuth2 could be a good choice for your
anthentication service. It's tested, there are a lot of clients and
documentations.
Your clients will be good to know that you are just using
Oauth2 and nothing strange.

Well, I am not here to share all my opinion in one single post, all of them are
just example of what is for an opinion.

Be wise is something that I am looking for, because wise for me means have
opinions but feel free to change them if you feel something better.

An opinion is really important! But it's just an opinion!

Like Software Engineer you need to have an opinion because every day people
will try to have opinion for you: Microservices, containers, one big
repository, golang/rust.

To build an opinion you need to make experience and to study it's a big effort
but to be really wise you need also to stay ready to change your
opinion.

In my opinion this is the main different between smart and wise people. I
prefer the second one!
