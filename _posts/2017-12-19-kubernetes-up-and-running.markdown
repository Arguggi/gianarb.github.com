I read ["Kubernetes up and running"](https://amzn.to/2zflChj) an O'Reilly book
written by Kelsey Hightower, Brendan Burns and Joe Beda.

It looks like the instrumental manual, you look for it when you buy something.
Based on your knowledge of it you read or not that manual.

I have a good knowledge of containers, orchestrator and cloud computing but I
never worked with Kubernetes until 2 weeks ago when I started a co-managed k8s
cluster on scaleway with [Lorenzo](https://twitter.com/fntlnz).

The book is well written, I read it in less than one week. The chapters are well
split because I was able to jump "Builiding a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster"
because I am not really interested without any pain.

Chapters like "Deploying real world applications", "Service Discovery" are good
and the book covers all the basic concepts that you need to know about
Kubernetes. You can feel all the experience that the three authors have on the
topic. There are gold feedbacks about what they learned using and building what
is now the orchestration standard.

Just to summarize, if you are using kubernetes and you like papers, this book is
a good way to have a documentation on paper. If you are new to Kubernetes is the
best way to start.

Thanks to all the authors! If you have any questions let me know
