## GoReleaser and BuildKit

The main reason about why I started "Show me your code" is to chat with a couple
of friends from the open source space about what they are doing, what I am doing.
And ideally have a drink: beers, water or coffe based on timezone discussing the same topic.

Me, Carlos and Tibor will meet on Skype for an informal chat about two open
source project I love: GoReleaser and BuildKit. The conversation will be
streamed on Twitch.

You can follow the event live, or the recording will be available here! Watching
it lives will give you the unique opportunity to share your love for those
projects and your feedback about how to support multi arch docker build in
GoReleaser.

**IMPORTANT:** The outcome of this conversation will not force in any way Carlos
to do anything! I hope the experience you as attendees and user of GoReleaser
can share and the experience Tibor has with buildkit will drive to a possible
integration. Because I will love to have multi arch support for my releases!

I had this idea because there is a long-standing PR about this
["Support multi-platform docker
images#530"](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/issues/530) and I am sure
that a discussion all together will be constructive and nice!

## About Carlos and GoReleaser

I am very excited to have [Carlos](https://twitter.com/caarlos0) with me, I
relay so much on [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) and its integration with
GitHub action to make my development life cycle reliable, repeatable and fast,
and I am happy to have a chat about its project and what he will do next!

## About Tibor from Docker and BuildKit

[Tibor @tiborvass](https://twitter.com/tiborvass) is a well-known contributor
and maintainer for Docker since the early days. Active on various open source
communities he is now involved with BuildKit as maintainer.

We know each other virtually and thanks to DockerCon and other events since I
joined the Docker Captain program, I am happy to have him around showing
BuildKit, buildx and the multi arch feature.
