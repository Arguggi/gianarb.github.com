See you Saturday 30th May at 10.30am (CEST/Rome/Berlin)

Everything speaks about GitOps those days! Everyone in their own way. Some
people think that GitOps means pulling git from inside a kubernetes cluster,
other people think it has to be done in CI.

I don’t know how it works or how it should work but my friend Ivan Pedrazas
(@ipedrazas) knows, so we are gonna learn from it.

The idea is to take a simple application and try to figure out how to apply
GitOps to it. Let’s see how far we go.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My plan is to show a
simple app (frontend in vue.js and a flask API), how to build the different
components, how to deploy them using GitOps. Finally, we will modify different
parts of the app and build and deploy and rinse and repeat :)</p>&mdash; Ivan
