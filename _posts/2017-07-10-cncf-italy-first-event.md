This will be a full evening about OpenTracing. OpenTracing [turns the light on
for
microservices](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2016/10/20/opentracing-turning-the-lights-on-for-microservices/).
It is a specification to store and manage trace. How can we follow what's going
on from the beginning to the end of our requests? What's happening when they
cross different services? Where is the bottleneck? Tracing helps you to
understand what's going on. It's not just for microservices but also for
caching, queue system an so on. Have a [look at the
trends](https://trends.google.it/trends/explore?q=opentracing) we need to know
more about it!

Beers, Pizza are offered by CNCF after the two sessions!
