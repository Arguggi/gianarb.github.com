## Kubernetes extendibility and NodeJS

Almost everybody that is currently working on Kubernetes, developing extensions,
controllers, operator is doing it in Go. That's reasonable because Kubernetes is
written Go and there is a lot of code that you can reuse in that language.

What if you are not a Go developer?

Walter coded a shared informer in NodeJS that watches and take actions on Pod
events.
