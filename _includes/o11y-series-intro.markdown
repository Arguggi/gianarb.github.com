## Introduction

This article is part of a series I am writing about a
side project I made called [o11y.guru](https://o11y.guru). Who knows what this
series or the project itself will become. The reason why I started it was to
have my **wonderland**. A place where I was able to do my mistakes without any
intermediary.

This series is about my journey there. I will keep the this `Introduction`
common to all the articles part of this series and I will keep a `Table of
Content` up to date. The best way to follow my journey here is to subscribe to
the RSS feed or to follow me on [@twitter](https://twitter.com/gianarb).

### what is this project?

I had this idea to create a mechanism to enable other people that uses twitter
to follow a group of leaders in a particular space. I decided to start from the
observability (#o11y) because it is the area where I am in at the moment.

[o11y.guru](https://o11y.guru) is pretty simple, a list of faces and a
button, they you press it and if you will authorize the twitter application you
will get to follow them.
