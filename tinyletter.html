            <h2  id="what-email">What is this email about?</h2>
            <p>With this subscription, you will get a be-weekly(sh) letter in your inbox full
            of links, contents, events about Go, SRE, Cloud Computing, Open source, and
            programming that I created, discovered, read that inspired me in a way or
            another.</p>

            <p>As you know, I like to build and to share what I do, but there are a lot of
            different platforms I use: Twitter, other blog posts, youtube videos, podcasts.</p>
            <p>A newsletter is a way to stay in touch, no matter the platform you follow.</p>

            <h2 id="why-subscribed">Why am I subscribed?</h2>

            <p>Across many years of activity as creator, I build a list of emails that will
            come from my blog post or <a href="https://scaledocker.com">scaledocker.com</a>; for months, I never sent any email
            because I didn't have an editor line. So if you do not recall why you get my
            email, I am sorry, there is always a link to unsubscribe, and I promise you
            won't hear from me any longer.</p>
