When somebody asks me why Kubernetes got so much traction the answer is always
the same: “its extendibility”. You can run it everywhere, almost all cloud
providers or bare metal providers can deliver a managed or integrated
distribution of Kubernetes. This is because it acts as a pluggable API gateway
to manage your infrastructure across providers. As a developer or infrastructure
operator having the ability to write the best integration your company or team
needs is a huge plus. During this talk, Gianluca will show you the different
integration points you can use to extend Kubernetes such as shared informers,
controller, kubectl plugin. Concepts are generically applicable to Kubernetes,
code will mainly be in Go.
